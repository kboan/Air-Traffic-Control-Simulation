# Air Traffic Control Simulation System

## Overview

The Air Traffic Control Simulation System is designed to simulate the management of air traffic in a controlled airspace environment. This project aims to optimize flight paths, enhance safety, and manage air traffic using modern software development practices. It provides a dynamic simulation environment where users can interact with and control simulated air traffic scenarios.

## Project Objectives

- To develop a realistic air traffic control simulation with various types of aircraft and flight operations.
- To implement a user-friendly interface that allows real-time control and monitoring of air traffic.
- To ensure the system is scalable, maintainable, and secure, accommodating future enhancements and higher traffic volumes.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Java
- **Frontend:** React
- **Others:** Docker, Git for version control

## Features

- Real-time simulation of multiple aircraft within a regional airport's airspace.
- Dynamic control of flight paths, scheduling, and emergency handling.
- Interactive graphical user interface for monitoring and controlling the air traffic.

## Getting Started

This section will be updated with instructions on how to set up and run the simulation, including any necessary installation steps and dependencies.
