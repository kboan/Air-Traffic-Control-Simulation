# Air Traffic Control Simulation Project - Requirements Specification

## Functional Requirements

### Aircraft Types

- The simulation will include various types of aircraft such as commercial jets, private planes, and military aircraft.
- Aircraft will differ by size, speed, and flight capabilities, impacting their handling requirements and airspace usage.

### Airspace Management

- The simulated airspace will cover a typical regional airport with dimensions adequate to manage inbound and outbound flights, including altitude layers.
- The simulation will include one primary airport but should be extensible to multiple airports in future versions.
- Airspace sectors will be dynamically managed based on traffic density and weather conditions.

### Flight Operations

- The simulation will manage all standard flight operations including takeoff, landing, taxiing, and in-flight maneuvers.
- Emergency situations like system failures and severe weather conditions will be programmatically introduced to test response strategies.

### Traffic Control Functionalities

- Core functionalities will include flight scheduling, routing, and real-time collision avoidance systems.
- The system will allow manual input from the user for rerouting or rescheduling flights as well as automated responses based on predefined rules.

### User Interface Requirements

- The user interface will display real-time information such as aircraft positions, designated flight paths, and current weather conditions.
- Users will have controls to alter flight paths, schedule flights, and manage emergencies.
- Multiple user roles will be supported, including tower controller and ground controller, each with specific access and control capabilities.

## Non-functional Requirements

### Performance

- The system should respond to user inputs and update displays within 2 seconds under normal operation conditions.
- Latency should not exceed 5 seconds even under high load conditions.

### Scalability

- Initially, the system should handle up to 50 aircraft simultaneously, with the capability to scale up as needed.
- Scalability to additional airports and increased user base should be considered in the design.

### Reliability and Availability

- The system is expected to have an uptime of 99.9% during operational hours.
- Failover mechanisms should be implemented to handle system crashes without loss of critical data.

### Security

- Basic security measures will be implemented, including user authentication and secure data handling, to protect system integrity and user data.

### Maintainability and Extensibility

- The system will be designed with modular components to facilitate easy maintenance and the addition of new functionalities such as new aircraft types or additional airports.
